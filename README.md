### [Task 1](https://github.com/almostinf/computational_mathematics/tree/main/task1)
- direct problem of error theory
- Complete inverse problem of error theory

This is my variant: `z(x) =√sin(x+ 0.74) sh(0.8x2+ 0.1), x= 0.1(0.01)0.2;`

### [Task 2](https://github.com/almostinf/computational_mathematics/tree/main/task2)
- Implementation of LU decomposition of a matrix with selection of the leading element by column, also the check `LU = PAQ` is implemented
  Using the LU decomposition, we find:
  - matrix determinant
  - solution to SLAE `Ax = b` is found
  - inverse matrix
  - conditionality number
- modified algorithm for finding the rank of degenerate matrices
- QR decomposition
- Jacobi and Seidel methods for solving SLAEs. A priori and posterior estimates are implemented

### [Task 3](https://github.com/almostinf/computational_mathematics/tree/main/task3)
Implementation of Newton method and modified Newton method of scalar nonlinear algebraic equation and system of nonlinear algebraic equations

### [Task 4](https://github.com/almostinf/computational_mathematics/tree/main/task4)
- Newton-Cotes method implementation 
- implementation of Gauss method
- error estimated by Richardson method
- the speed of convergence is estimated by the Aitken rule

This is my variant: f(x) = 3 cos(1.5x) exp(x/4) + 4 sin(3.5x) exp(-3x) + 4x, a= 2.5, b= 3.3, α=2/3, β= 0
